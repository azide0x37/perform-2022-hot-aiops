# AIOps - Leverage the power of Davis for Auto-Remediation 

Todayâ€™s IT environments are growing in terms of size and complexity. The speed of the digital marketplace requires an automated delivery pipeline and enhanced remediations in case of failures. End-to-end monitoring for enterprise applications can easily be automated. Not only does automation produce deterministic and consistent outcomes in large environments, it can also save you a lot of time.

## The application
We will be using an application called EasyTravel that provides a web portal which allows users to log in, search for journeys to various destinations, select promotional journeys directly that are offered and to book a journey using credit card details. 

## The dashboard
After exercise 3 you can get into dashboard.xx.xx.xx.nip.io (xx.xx.xx is your IP assigned in the Dynatrace University) and visualize all the applications.

## Remediation overview
This is the remediation workflow that will be implemented
